well  lets back to the early s   where tv is in every house even in every room  video sets are there too  rental video stores everywhere and satellite receivers and cable channels growing fast  with many channels for kids and teenagers making them attached more and more into screens  not to mention video games  game boy and nintendo those from this new generation who read are weirdos  or  nerds to the rest of their peers and for those few who read book stores mostly got for them just comics and graphic novels  which most of them created early this century the classic novels they read just for schools and education  otherwise they merely know the movies that based on the new novels that make a best seller are the ones which made  or will be made  into movies for julia roberts  tom cruse or any of the s hollywood celebrity   or the ones by stephen king because  of course  will be made into movies too even these novels didn t live up the selling numbers of tolkien  charles dickens  agatha christie  whats with the british authors and selling numbers      also in russia no more dostoevsky and tolstoy   no more hugo in france also in egypt no more like naguib mahfouz and the great authors of the s to s   no new big hit for novels  most of the selling books are those of speculation about strange and mysterious things in the world or in religion dreams explications   cocking books or just celebrities rumors while in us and uk it selling books mostly the self help books  or those which teach how to make computers programs or even web sites  this brand new huge technology leap back then no new novels to attract the new generation of kids and teenagers  just some few successful highlights like r l stines goosepumbs in  which make a very good success  and translated in many countries including egypt and in egypt theres also a very successful project made by the modern arabic institution for publishing   distribution which made pocket novels for youth   by brilliant egyptian writers who presented excellent variety of novels of many genres  sci fi  action thriller  comics  romance  etc theres also reading for all project by the first lady susan mubarak which printed a huge verity of important books and novels from all over the world in very cheap prices but all these effort didn t attract more and more of new youth readers  it just made more and more books for those few who already reads the vast numbers of those who dont just read will increase if there isn t a big new attractive reading experience to get them into reading  specially with the more channels  more movies but the biggest obstacle for them to read came out in and became a real phenomenon by    its the playstation   the giant japanese gaming leap  football  crash   pepsi man  and the comics heroes also have their games   so why reading superman   batmans comics when you can play them                                                                                                      so by  with this growing leap in gaming  as also the computer d games getting even much improves  books get replaced bit by bit by a gaming controls so do you think its wise for publishers to publish a book for new writer of course not  it may even cover its publishing cost so it was very normal when in this year    when joanne  a  years old lady from england   handed the manuscript for her first novel to  publishing houses  all of them rejected it   a manuscript of over  pages of a novel  that she had hard times in her personal and professional life while writing it  and for children    seriously is there still any who still read  its   the era of playstation and video games but then  the modest bloomsbury agreed to publish it  with  advises for her  first that shed get a day job  since its a little chance of making money in children s books    later she received a grant from the scottish arts council to help her continuing writing  but the significant advice was to change her pen name cause young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman  so with her name and her grandmothers  kathleen  come the  initial of her pen namej   k   rowling and in th june   with   copies   of which were distributed to libraries  come out in uk  to our world the greatest harry potter and the philosopher s stoneand baam   everything happened so fast  before the end of this year the novel awarded many important litural awards in the uk  an american important publisher   scholastic   won the rights to publish the novel in us  with a huge check rowling would never dreams of just with small change  the title changes from philosopher s stone to the sorcerer s stone   as the american publisher saw that philosopher s may not be that attractive to young readers  and thanks to harry potter  now every young readers know much more about philosopher s stone from their other reads in  book  released in uk   in us  winning more literary prizes  becoming a top selling books in uk  us and many other countries which start to publish the translation for the first book  and on  july   the first breaking record made when book  sold   copies in just three days after its release in the united kingdom  and more copies when it released late  in us  with the fast growing popularity of harry potter among readers   more records had been broken both in uk and us     the  books takeover the top spot in the charts of best selling books for weeks and months  and it was still the hardcover editions this conquer made some literary magazines and newspapers separate the harry potter books selling records from the rest of the top selling books  splitting its lists into children books and adult books sections under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher ranking  and then it was year    where everything is about to change      forever  the playstation  is out there  and even higher leap in computer games  but even with this much of temptations  thousands of children  teens and parents gathered in the midnight of  july  in uk and us at the same day in front of stores  not electronic stores or apple stores  as theses days    it was bookstores  for may be the first time in the book stores history   to buy a copy of     harry potter and the goblet of fireand they didn t mind to find out that the book is over  page  it was even for their pleasure  more than double the size of any of the first  novels  double the thriller  double the fun  over  million copies sold at that day only in the us   a new world record   a totally unexpected one huge story  bigger plot   mysterious and very well written  more literate prizes for rowling    more translated editions to more than  language  and huge budget for the upcoming first movie of the series  which beautifully visualize the magic of the novel by the faithful producers and the director   and it also made some records   but that s not our subject now                                                                                      by the announcement of pushing the publishing date of book  to mid    and even by  movies out so far  the hunger for reading harry potter kept on   also   as more readers start to increase into this generation  publishers and book stores start to promote for more books for those readers who are hungry for more  older fantasy books   like lord of the rings  which was a super successful movie by then too  narnia   golden compass and many other novels which finally getting more reprinted editions   and so book stores to get

that the magic of harry potter is one of the main factors of this magic  this boy will be famous  there wont be a child in our world who doesnt know his name that s what rowling wrote at the very early pages of her first book  the one that rejected by  publishing houses in    well  what about now god  talked too much in the  brief  introduction   didn t i well  that s it for this review    i guess some still think it s just the propaganda that made that all    well i ll try to prove them worng by the upcoming next  reviews at the other  books of the series  links will be here as soon as it d done       now i ll be back to go around hogwarts     for the zillionth time i guess  hope to see you there too  come on and try first year   from hogwartsmohammed arabeyre reading the new edition  guess i m addicted to new editions but this one really rocks   bloomsbury  from  sep  till  sep  how can more than half of my goodreads friends be wrong with this i have to get this right  as of this writing  i have  goodreads friends       of them have read j  k  rowling s harry potter and the sorcerer s stone  out of those who read this       rated this with  stars   of them with  stars  all the others gave  or   only  rated this with  star  one of them admitted not being able to finish it  she should not have rated it really since she did not read its entirety   but she is my friend and it is her right  so why question  when the book came out in   i was not yet a bookworm so i brushed this aside  i read only those books that my brother told me to read  he was the bookworm but he would not be caught reading any book being pushed by media hype  however  when warner bros  released the film adaptation in   my daughter was  years old and i thought that  since there was too much hype  the movie must be good and we would have a memorable time with our first ever father daughter movie date  i was wrong  she not only got scared because of the darkness inside the movie house but she trembled with fear during the life size human chess game  in that scene when ron was sacrificed  we left the movie in that scene with my daughter crying and me cursing it  i will never read harry potter my daughter is now  going   she is not fond of movies and she still does not show interest on reading harry potter  however  i am now a bookworm and the other week  i was with my  goodreads friends and  of them raved  two of them  again  about harry potter books  oh well  first time fathers can make mistakes about first movie date with their daughters  book  is included in  must read books and the book must be a quick read  so the following day  i bought my copy after  years of the book s existence and me ignoring it  did i finally make a good decision of reading it  are all of those  friends of mine in goodreads wrong in giving this  stars  most of them did not bother writing a review  maybe those would be too long or maybe they read this when they were not in goodreads yet  but i am in goodreads already so i can make this review long these are what some of them say  it was a great book i enjoyed reading it for an eloquent reviewer  she must have been too happy to express herself  such a great story and creative way of writing  i love harry potter  yes  i agree about the story being great and j  k  rowling being creative  i was secretly wishing i was studying in hogwarts too  it was silly  but i was simply enraptured by harry potter  honestly  i still am    it was a great book  i enjoyed reading it coming from one of my favorite reviewers in goodreads  i do not share her wanting to be a sorcerer though  honestly  i don t know anybody who d refuse to even entertain the thought of attending a school for wizards  another one of my favorite reviewers  that seems to have nailed this  young people wanting to be in hogwarts and study sorcery  that should be it  the world seems to be a dreadful place that we would all like to have powers to turn our enemies into frogs  pigs  ride on a broomstick and get the snitch and earn points  money  for our family oh well  the bible says that sorcery is satan s work  the book even used the word transfiguration as a subject in the sorcery school  blasphemy just kidding  this is a work of fiction and i am not too old to appreciate it  i was just kidding  to be frank  i tried hard not to like this  i thought that giving this a  or  will freak out my friends and somehow get votes from those who are  up to now  ignoring this book  i told you so  why waste your time    however  unless you are a grumpy old man woman  there is nothing not to like about this book  i maybe too old for it but hey  talent is talent and j  k  rowling has it my  friends are indeed right
